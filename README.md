## laravel react node js
Conversion from php react to laravel react:
in this phase 5 we have converted from php to laravel mvc framework;
## view
we moved the react components to the resources/js/components folder and rendered the root component in welcome.blade.php file element.
These components serve as the view part in the mvc model.
## controller
we migrated the php by creating controllers to handle actions in the App\http\controller folders. 
These controllers receive the request and process the result with the models present in App\Models.
## model
These models interact with the DB tables and 
performs queries on respective tables defined in the model.
## routes
For routing we have defined all the major api routes in routes/api.php file that routes multiple request to its respective destinations.

# chat
chat server is built using node js, react js & laravel php and can be found in resources/js/components/chat & /server folders.

## About Laravel
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
